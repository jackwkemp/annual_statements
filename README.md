# Annual Statement Generator

This project was developed to automate the generation of Annual Statements for a Taxi fleet. It was designed to improve customer support efficiency by eliminating manual effort in producing these statements.

## Objective
Reduce the time spent on generating statements from five minutes per driver to a fully automated process.

## How It Works
- The SQL code generates the required data in Metabase.
- The results are downloaded as a CSV.
- The CSV is then sent to the appropriate driver.
