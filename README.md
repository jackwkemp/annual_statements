# Generating an Annual Statement using SQL

An example of a piece of work I completed at my previous employer.

Aim:
To improve our customer support efficiency, by being able to automatically generate Annual Statements for our Taxi fleet.

The process to provide an Annual Statement took approximately five minutes per statement.
The attached code was designed to be run in Metabase, download the result as a .csv and send to the appropriate driver.
